# Offline picker power-button availability

Owner feedback UI08: the authored top-right power button is disabled while
Offline with Bots is open. It should remain available and require confirmation
before exiting, avoiding accidental shutdown.

## Current evidence and scope

The cached Home/Match worker lifecycle and owned picker epochs are already on
the base branch. Preserve those ownership fences and the player's original
installed Scaleform widgets; do not add a replacement power icon or dialog.

Static review finds no dedicated quit-confirmation route in the current
frontend bridge. Generic BasePanelRunCommand dispatch closes other pages and
passes unknown commands to the main thread; quit/quitgame then exits directly.
That does not prove which authored power-button callback is missing or whether
the picker blocks the original hit target. Actual public callback/property and
rendered evidence is needed before choosing a fix.

The next observation will inspect the original Home power target, open the
original picker and compare its public enable/input state. Establish the
authored confirmation widget/callback through ordinary public API observations
and legitimate references. Do not inspect authored function bodies or bytecode.

No runtime pass or original-confirmation fidelity is claimed yet. Private
captures remain outside the repository. Builds and graphical observations use
the parent agent's shared resource leases.
